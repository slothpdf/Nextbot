Our game is a 3D, first person game where you have to collect pages in order to win the game. These pages are interactable and hidden throughout the map. 
The Player must go looking for them but have to avoid 4 different AI enemies that are patrolling certain areas of the map. If the AI enemies 
get you, you die and have to restart the game and try again.
